<h4><b>WHAT IS WEB 4.0?</b></h4>

<h4>The evolution of Internet, from the beginning to web 4.0</h4> 

<p>The Internet age has known many definitions. 
   At the beginning there was what we call now <strong>web 1.0</strong>, back then simply named as web. Were developed the first websites, 
   portals and online services and users could only read the information, without the chance of a direct interaction. 
   It was the web of one-way communication.</p>
<p>Then arrives the <strong>web 2.0</strong>, with the emergence and proliferation of <strong>social networks</strong> and all the applications as blogs, 
   forums and podcasts, that made possible new forms of participative communication. Indeed, because of the development of these new instruments, 
   users started to communicate among them and share contents through the web, helping to generate the content itself. From a passive actor the user becomes the lead in the creation and management of online contents, 
   by building new processes and dynamics in what we can also call <strong>collaborative web</strong>.</p>
