<h1><b>WHAT IS WEB 4.0?</b></h1>

<h1>The evolution of Internet, from the beginning to web 4.0</h1> 

<p>The Internet age has known many definitions. 
   At the beginning there was what we call now <strong>web 1.0</strong>, back then simply named as web. <br> Were developed the first websites, 
   portals and online services and users could only read the information, without the chance of a direct interaction. <br>
   It was the web of one-way communication.</p>
<p>Then arrives the <strong>web 2.0</strong>, with the emergence and proliferation of <strong>social networks</strong> and all the applications as blogs, 
   forums and podcasts, that made possible new forms of participative communication.<br> Indeed, because of the development of these new instruments, 
   users started to communicate among them and share contents through the web, helping to generate the content itself.<br> From a passive actor the user becomes the lead in the creation and management of online contents, 
   by building new processes and dynamics in what we can also call <strong>collaborative web</strong>.</p>

<h2>Web 3.0</h2>
   
<p> Here we come to the third stage, web 3.0. They called like that for the first time in 2006, and it is characterized more by a series of factors than by a particular technology. The watchword is connection.</p>
<ul>
   <li><strong>Semantic web</strong>: a virtual environment in which information and data are connected and organized so that they can be processed automatically.<br> In short, a web in which the machines read contents and also interpret them.</li>
   <li><strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong>: all the new technologies based on Artificial Intelligence, able to interact with users in an almost human way</li>
   <li><strong>Enhanced web</strong>: a concept that refers to a sociological aspect for which the web is considered the communication channel that can affects reality the most, in a superior way compared to all the other media until now.</li>
   <li><strong>Merger of poles</strong>: there are no more two different poles, the user and the web, but they have merged in a continuous process of co-creation</li>
   <li><strong>3D web</strong>: transformation of the web in three-dimensional environments following on from “Second Life”</li>
   <li><strong>Web as database</strong>: the possibility of using the network as a huge database full of information that the applications can easily provide to users and that improves online researches.<br> All these factors contribute to characterize the web 3.0 as an era in which Internet deeply came into our lives, by becoming an integral part of our daily life where <b>we are all always connected, anytime and anywhere</b>.</li>
</ul>   
<h2>And web 4.0?</h2>
   
<p>Recently they have been talking about web 4.0, with the related future predictions. Surely in the next stage of web technologies of augmented reality and Big data will have a main role.<br> It is suspected that it will be an age in which each person will have a <bold>digital alter ego</bold> and will talk<br> more and more with new interfaces, like intelligent machines.<br> There’s also a pretty dystopian vision of the web in the future, with a <bold>greater control of the information</bold> that will affect not only the digital world but also the reality around us.
